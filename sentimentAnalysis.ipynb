    "The dataset is available [here](https://www.kaggle.com/kazanova/sentiment140).\n",

    "\n",
    "The dataset being used is the sentiment140 dataset. It contains 1,600,000 tweets extracted using the Twitter API. The tweets have been annotated (0 = Negative, 4 = Positive) and they can be used to detect sentiment.\n",

    "It contains the following 6 fields:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - sentiment: the polarity of the tweet (0 = negative, 4 = positive)\n",
    "    - ids: The id of the tweet (2087)\n",
    "    - date: the date of the tweet (Sat May 16 23:58:44 UTC 2009)\n",
    "    - flag: The query (lyx). If there is no query, then this value is NO_QUERY.\n",
    "    - user: the user that tweeted (robotickilldozr)\n",
    "    - text: the text of the tweet (Lyx is cool)\n"
